Homework Feedback:

Functionality:
- Completion: All of the features work!! Nice job. I like having the different links available on the page, from an user experience standpoint. (20/20)
- Bug Free: The app does seem bug free. Maybe thinking through edge cases for when the user tries to delete and no cats exist would be a good thing to include. (10/10)

Quality:
- Good Coding Practices: I commented your code with different coding practices you could follow, including what to have in your backend, versus thinking through how your front-end should work, but great work! (9/10)
- Readability: Functions and variable names should be camelCased, good comments, but look at my comments about readability in our handlebars files. (9/10)


Keep up the good work!! :)
